	<h1> Current Projects </h1>
	<p> In Innovation Lab one of my project assignments was to design a lamp.
I decided to use mahogany wood for this project. I created my design to have a modern look, so I created a cube that is small and the light peers through the measured and cut holes.
In this project I learned in the process of cutting the holes you have to be careful to not cut at an angle. In conclusion, during this project I learned how to become a better craftsman and designer.
